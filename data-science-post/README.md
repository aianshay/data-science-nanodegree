## Description

A blog post where one dataset is analyzed and I write about the insights obtained. In this project, I analyze an AirBnB dataset of the city of Rio de Janeiro.

## Dependencies

- Python (>= 3.7.4)
- scikit-learn (>=0.24.1)
- wordcloud (>= 1.8.1)
- seaborn (>=0.11.1)
- matplotlib.pyplot (>=3.3.3)
- numpy (>=1.19.5)

## Key insights

- Copacabana, Barra da Tijuca and Ipanema are by far the neighborhoods with the most accommodations.
- The cheapest period to rent a place is from March to May.
- Number of bedrooms, how many it accommodates and location are the most influential features on a listing price.

## Files

Kudos to this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/allanbruno/helping-regular-people-price-listings-on-airbnb) from Allan Bruno, where I could find a functional way to remove outliers properly!
