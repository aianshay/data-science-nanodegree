# Recommendations with IBM

## Description

In this project, I created different kinds of recommendations engines for the users of the IBM Watson Studio platform, it makes recommendations about new articles it thinks they will like. The dataset was provided by IBM, which contains interactions between the users and the articles. The building of such algorithms can be found in the notebook above, it is divided as the following:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data cleaning/preprocessing
- Rank-based Recommendations
- User-based Collaborative Filtering
- Content-based Recommendations
- Matrix Factorization with SVD

## Files

- the jupyter notebook contains all the code used to build the recommendations algorithms.
- `data` contains the datasets used.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to IBM for provinding the datasets.
