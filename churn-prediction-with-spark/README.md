## Description

Churn is defined as the event when a user leaves or unsubscribes from a service. Predicting this event is already an important part of businesses as Netflix, Spotify and YouTube. When predicting this event, companies can offer incetives so the user doesn't leave the plataform, potentially saving a lot of money. Other than thar, it's also an opportunity of understanding why users are leaving the product, and which improvements can be made.

## Dependencies

- Python (>= 3.7.4)
- pyspark (>=2.4.3)
- seaborn (>=0.11.1)
- matplotlib.pyplot (>=3.3.3)

## Key insights

- In the beggining of the project I wasn't so sure of how to exactly use the data I had do make the predict churn, I had to 'sleep with the problem' to visualize that I could build new features using the initial data.
- Number of active days and number of sessions were the most important features to predict churn.

## Files
